= Overview

Testerra provides an advanced reporting of the test results with the `Report-NG` module.
A report generated with `Report-NG` consists of these different views:

* Dashboard - a general overview of the test run
* Tests - a detailed list of the individual tests
* Failure Aspects - a summary of the different types of failures
* Logs - a panel that contains detailed logging information
* Threads - a graphical view of the thread activities during the parallel test execution

The report is generated after the test execution in the folder "test-report/report-ng" and can be viewed with a standard web browser.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Unfortunately, because the report is a highly dynamic application based on java script, the security settings of most browsers do not allow to directly view the report by opening the file test-report/report-ng/index.html. But we will show you workarounds for this.
